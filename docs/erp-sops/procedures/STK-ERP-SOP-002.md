> ማስጠንቀቂያ፦ ይህ ሰነድ ረቂቅ ነው፤ ያልጸደቀ ወይም ያልተፈተነ የሶፍትዌር ችሎታ እንዳለ አያረጋግጥም።

## 1. ዓላማ / Purpose

Users, roles, locations and approvals. ሂደቱ በማስረጃ፣ በፈቃድ፣ በገምጋሚና በተመዘገበ ውጤት ይፈጸማል።

## 2. የሥራ ደረጃዎች / Procedure

1. በተፈቀደ ጥያቄ ላይ ብቻ ሚናና ቦታ ይመድቡ።
2. የተከለከለ role፣ የተለወጠ record ID እና የተሰረዘ user በAPI ይከልከሉ።

## 3. English operating controls

1. Grant least privilege and location scope; approve privileged access independently.
2. Test API allow/deny, direct-object access, revoked accounts and audit history.

## 4. Shared controls

- Separate maker/reviewer/approver for high-risk operations.
- Enforce authorization, location scope and record state on the server; UI hiding is not security.
- Keep event/ledger history immutable; correct posted stock/financial entries through linked reversals.
- Missing evidence, authorization, legal rule or reconciliation means HOLD; do not guess values.

## 5. Required evidence

- Source/reference document, actor, timestamp, location and record ID where applicable.
- Approval/exception record, reconciliation and linked ledger/journal IDs.
- Relevant CI/staging test receipt and exact artifact hash where the process depends on release.
